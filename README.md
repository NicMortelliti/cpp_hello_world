# Learning C++: Hello World

[C++ Tutorial from freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-learn-the-c-programming-language/)

[C++ Dev Container](https://github.com/devcontainers/templates/tree/main/src/cpp)

## Dependencies

- Docker

- VS Code

## Project set up

1. Ensure Docker Engine is running

    In a terminal enter `docker ps`. You should see a list of currently running containers. If no Docker Engine is running but no containers are running you'll just see column headers:

    `CONTAINER ID    IMAGE    COMMAND...`

1. Clone this repo.

1. Open project in VS Code

1. Open the command pallette (Windows: Ctrl+Shift+P, MacOS: CMD+Shift+P) and enter `Dev Containers: Reopen in Container`

    This will pull the necessary C++ development and build dependencies.
